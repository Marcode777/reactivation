<!-- webpack: Before we used to have to make separate files and then load them onto the html separately on their separate script tags. Now it has evolved into module loading systems. 
So beforehand we install Node.JS, then npm init to get a package.json going and then install webpack. Then npm install -g webpack. Then create webpack.config.js, and inside can be a sample start-up webpack. If it's production, if so then we'll run minification, and we won't do source-mapping, if it's not production, then we'll consider it debugging mode and we'll do inline sourcemaps. Our entry point is, in this case, ./js/scripts.js, this is where we're starting off. Our output is the /js folder.



***Excerpt of advice from YouTube: The easiest way to set up your project is to make a directory tree structure the way it's displayed on his sublime text editor.  If you can't make out the structure, do this:  create your project folder; inside the project folder create a 'src' folder; inside the 'src' folder, create a 'js' folder.  You will now create four files.  Create two empty files,  'package.json' and a 'webpack.config.js', and place them at the top level of your project folder.  Create another empty file, 'index.html' and put it inside your 'src' folder.   Create the last file, 'client.js' and place it inside 'js' folder.

Now advance the video to 3:04 and simply type what you see into your 'client.js' file.  As for the contents of the other three files, you can go to the github repository he listed in the  comments under the video.  Specifically, you will need to access the '1-basic-react' folder to get the contents of each the other three files.  

After you have set up your folders and copied the files, you run 'npm install', then 'webpack',  and the rest of the folders and files will be automatically installed.  At this point you can advance to '2:38' in  the video and continue following along.  Hope this helps you and anyone else who might have the same question.ï»¿***-->


<!-- the contents in webpack.config.js are from https://github.com/learncodeacademy/react-js-tutorials/blob/master/1-basic-react/webpack.config.js
the contents from package.json are from https://github.com/learncodeacademy/react-js-tutorials/blob/master/1-basic-react/package.json, the only thing I changed was the name, to "reactivation", for my own work-->
<!-- before, when i ran "npm install", then "webpack", it said "bash webpack command not found" I realized that I had to first "npm install webpack" first, and then run "webpack" and this seemed to work-->
<!-- I can continue onto 2:38 of vid #1 now-->

<!-- so we also ran "webpack -- watcher", which watches our code for changes and as we save, it'll continue to do that. So if you change something in the code and save, it will retranspile everything.-->
<!-- after the comments in client.js, we're back here. So let's wrap up our workspace and our workflow here, obviously we'll want to get some kind of live reload happening, and webpack dev server is kind of the standard way of doing that. So let's go ahead and "npm install -S webpack-dev-server" and let's go ahead and get maybe an npm run dev command going. Well let's also install webpack dev server globally as well, by typing "npm install -g webpack-dev-server" which we won't be using, but we'll do it for now. Let's get webpack-dev-server installed globally so we have the webpack server command. Actually we need to give it a content base. Since we don't want to serve this folder that we're in right now, we want to serve the source folder, we're just going to go content base is source, so we'll type "webpack-dev-server --content-base src" So that way it's going to serve "index.html" as the root of that. So now we can actually go to "localhost 8080". And there we go, we have "localhost8080" working, let's get a split-screen going on, but we don't have live reload up yet. We can do two things, by default we can the iframe mode, which is "localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/index.html" and you'll see a loader bar up there, it'll automatically load your app into a brand new iframe everytime, so let's change the text, it's going to recompile and reload, so that's kind of smooth. So if that works for us straight out of the bag, that's great. Another thing we can do is we do the inline flag, and hot flag, hot will help it do inline a little bit better as in the console type "webpack-dev-server--content-base src --inline --hot". So if we have inline and hot, then we're not going to have that top, and it's just going to automatically do it inline which is basically live reload. So we're going to go ahead and take that command and we're just going to go ahead and make - that's kind of a mouthful to type everytime, so let's go ahead and add that to our package.json, let's go to our scripts and make it "dev" as in "dev": "webpack-dev-server --content-base src --inline --hot", so there we go, npm run dev now, will run this command for us.
"npm run dev" gets our full webpack-dev-server running, and we're up and rolling! The only the other thing we're going to change is, we don't want to have all our developers have to do an npm install global of webpack-dev-server, so we're actually going to reference the node module's bin, you can see that it installs a command of webpack-dev-server, it installs an executable webpack-dev-server as well, so we can actually execute this command in "dev": "webpack-dev-server --content-base src --inline --hot", with ./ as in "dev": "./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --content-base src --inline --hot", . That's taken care of by our package now as in "webpack-dev-server": "^1.15.0" in package.json, so now we can actually uninstall, as in "uninstall -g webpack-dev-server", we're going to uninstall that one as in "npm uninstall -g webpack-dev-server", and now npm run dev will still work, because we're referencing the one that's in our repository. So that's a little bit of a cleaner way. At first, with NodeJS, we always had everybody install a global for everything. And now we just think it's much cleaner to install it, with your package, install it locally to your app, that way the exact version you need for your app is installed in your app folder, and then you run it with a node script, npm run dev, or npm start, are kind of the standard choices that you would pick. So there we go, that's running, that's our setup for React.
